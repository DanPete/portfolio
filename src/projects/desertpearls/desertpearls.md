This is a custom Shopify theme-build using Slate, Shopifyâ€™s product to create sites using Webpack and NPM. The client requested a custom theme because they sell a wide range of products across numerous collections and wanted unique layouts. They also requested a user-friendly theme that was reusable for future use with their other products lines, including easily customizable design and functionality.
