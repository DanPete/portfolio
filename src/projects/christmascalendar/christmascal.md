My team and I created a Shopify app to assist shops in offering daily deals during the holidays. I developed the front end of the project by combining React with Shopify’s Polaris to create a settings dashboard. I also connected the database using Redux to ensure global state management throughout the app. 

We’re currently converting the app to a more versatile and customizable version that includes monthly, weekly, and daily sales.
