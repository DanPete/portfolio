This multi-faceted project required a total redesign aimed at modernizing and updating an existing theme. It was essential to showcase a variety of products in multiple formats and use lazy loading to prioritize fast loading times despite an image-heavy landing page.

With thousands of consistently revolving products, the client needed a robust filter that overcame Shopify’s limitations, so I implemented a dynamic filter with JavaScript. I also completed two customizable pages to help funnel users into their consignment and layaway programs.
